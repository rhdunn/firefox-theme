# Photon Light
This is a theme for Firefox 89+ that incorporates some of the Photon theme
elements. It is based on the following sources:
1. [Lepton](https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix) theme;
2. https://github.com/ShatteredIcicle/firefox-ui-regression-mending.

The intention of this theme is to make minimal changes that revert the
aspects of the new Proton theme I don't like. Specifically:
1. Restore the flat, compact tab look.
2. Join the tabs to the toolbar.
3. Restore the photon sound icon display.
4. Restore icons to the menu bar.

To install the theme, clone this project into a `chrome` folder of the root
folder for the Firefox profile you want to use the theme with.

The lepton theme is also available by including the `theme/lepton/chrom.css`
file in the `userChrome.css` stylesheet.
